# Chess engine

I wanted to create a chess engine and I also used the oportunity to improve my knowledge of rust, including the creation of UIs and servers

Chess engine is the crate that implements the core logic of chess

# Chess descktop

This is a raylib aplication that allows you to play chess against yourself!

Note that there is a release in this repository, this release is regarding this crate in particular

# Chess web API

This crate uses Axum to provide a web API to play chess online. It mainly uses websockets to be as interactive as possible

# Chess web UI

It's a web UI not written in rust, but it connects to the chess web API to control the game logic
